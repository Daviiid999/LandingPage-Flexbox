						<h2>Hence Flagship Store Madrid</h2>
						<p>The <b>flagship Hence Store</b> project in Madrid had the primary goal of modifying the layouts and uses of a <b>900 m2</b> space spread across three floors, with only <b>30 m2</b> at street level.</p>
	
						<p>To achieve this, the decision was made to place the brand's offices on the top floor and consider the retail space as the first two floors, which are entirely visible to the customer from the entrance. All existing stairs were demolished, leaving a stairwell as a spatial connection between the offices and the store, where three <b>large trees</b> were positioned.</p>

						<h2>Edmmond Valencia</h2>
						<p>The <b>Edmmond Valencia</b> project is located in front of one of the city's most emblematic monuments, the <b>Mercado de Col√≥n</b>, and therefore, the store's <b>facade</b> reflects the <b>elegance and sobriety</b> of this location.</p>
						<p>Inside the premises, a very limited palette of <b>colors and materials</b> is employed, conceptualizing the intervention with the use of <b>white walls</b> to enhance <b>brightness</b>, continuous <b>micro-cement flooring</b> to expand the space, and <b>ash wood carpentry</b> in decorative details to add <b>warmth</b>.</p>

						<h2>LDS Pharmacy</h2>
						<p>At <b>Sud Pharmacy</b>, we faced the challenge of addressing the issue of an old building constructed in multiple phases, upon which we needed to implement the program for a <b>newly opening pharmacy</b>.</p>
						<p>The diverse structures erected in each phase, some made of <b>concrete</b> and others of <b>steel</b>, made it challenging to comprehend the overall extensive area available. After removing the most detrimental pillars for the space, we found the solution to this problem to be the guiding thread of the project: the <b>metal joints</b> of the nearest <b>concrete and steel pillars</b> would serve as the decorative focal point.</p>

						<h2>Muroexe Goya</h2>
						<p>Continuing with the aesthetic world created for the <b>brand</b>, we adapted the idea to a <b>100m2</b> space on one of the most emblematic streets in Madrid: <b>Goya</b>.</p>
						<p>We chose to showcase the space in its <b>raw state</b>, with <b>metallic pillars</b> displaying <b>fire protection</b> and the structure with its <b>ceramic vaults</b> filled with the holes left by the passage of time. The current state is fixed by painting it <b>white</b> and leaving all the installations of the space and the building exposed.</p>

						<h2>Ritmo</h2>
						<p>The premises are located in the <b>heart</b> of the island and have the particularity of being a <b>detached building</b>, giving it <b>magnificent presence</b> from various perspectives.</p> 
						<p>The building rehabilitation project focused on removing palimpsests and emphasizing the <b>semi-circular arches</b> as the distinctive element of the structure. This intervention also aimed to repurpose the disused <b>roof</b> and integrate the building into the <b>Mediterranean surroundings</b> by applying a <b>lime coating</b> to the entire envelope.</p>

						<h2>EQA</h2>
						<p>Offices are not only <b>workspaces</b>; we must not forget the <b>commercial focus</b> that many of them have in their <b>DNA</b>. In this particular case, <b>EQA</b> is a company dedicated to the <b>certification and verification</b> of <b>R&D&I, quality, and ASG standards</b>; and that <b>commercial aspect</b> is part of its <b>corporate culture</b>. Therefore, the design of this <b>office renovation project</b> revolves around giving meaning and adapting the space to both <b>commercial</b> and purely <b>work-related</b> needs.</p>
						<p>With over <b>600 m2</b> of space, <b>EQA's offices</b> in <b>Plaza Castilla (Madrid)</b> stand out for their <b>sober, serious</b> character, but without forgetting the <b>modern touch</b> so necessary in today's <b>workspaces</b>.</p>

					<p>This house is located in a part of the city where, historically, the growing urban bourgeoisie of Valencia was settling after having previously occupied the Expansion and the La Exposici√≥n neighborhood, next to the Alameda. Clearly influenced by international trends, some talented architects were the authors of the buildings surrounding 'the landmarks' of these streets: the <b>Colegio Alem√°n</b>, the <b>Club de Tenis</b>, the <b>H√≠pica</b>, the chalets of the journalists, and the first university buildings.</p>
					<p><b>Pablo Navarro</b> and <b>Julio Trullenque</b>, <b>Guti√©rrez Soto</b>, <b>GO-DB</b>, <b>Borso di Carminati</b> and <b>Rafael Contel</b>, <b>Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a</b> and <b>Vicente Valls</b>, <b>Luis Pellegrero</b> or <b>Luis Mar√©s</b> are some of the professionals who built in this expanding neighborhood with proposals characterized by a city garden front in buildings of considerable height. As a clear-sighted detail of the combination of classism and construction emanating from the <b>Partial Plan</b> approved by the <b>Ministry of Housing</b> in 1960.</p>
